# Claude Workflow Package - Windows Edition

A Windows-compatible version of the Claude Code workflow system, cleaned up and customized for use without macOS-specific features or HumanLayer CLI dependencies.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before using this workflow package, you need:

### Required
- **Git** - Version control ([Download](https://git-scm.com/download/win))
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - For PR creation and management ([Download](https://cli.github.com/))
  - Run `gh auth login` after installation
- **VS Code** - With Claude Code extension
- **Thoughts Directory** - HumanLayer workflow structure (created by setup script)

### Optional
- **Node.js** - Only if using Linear integration ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Linear API Key** - For Linear ticket management ([Get API Key](https://linear.app/settings/api))

### Quick Check

Run these commands to verify:
```bash
git --version        # Should show Git version
gh --version         # Should show GitHub CLI version
gh auth status       # Should show "Logged in to github.com"
node --version       # Should show Node version (if using Linear)
```

If any are missing, run the setup script: `interactive-setup.bat`

## What's Included

This streamlined Windows version contains:
- **6 Specialized AI Agents** for codebase analysis
- **11 Workflow Commands** (all Windows-compatible)
- **Clean configuration** with no bash script dependencies
- **Linear integration support** (requires customization)

## What Was Removed

Compared to the original package, this version removes:
- ❌ macOS-only session orchestration commands (`ralph_*`, `oneshot*`, `create_worktree`)
- ❌ Bash scripts (they depend on HumanLayer CLI)
- ❌ HumanLayer-specific commands (`founder_mode`, `local_review`)
- ❌ Thoughts directory dependencies (using `_nt` variants)
- ❌ HumanLayer-specific Linear IDs (replaced with placeholders)

## Quick Start

**New User?** → [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)
**Need Linear?** → [LINEAR-SETUP.md](LINEAR-SETUP.md)
**Command Reference** → [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md)
**Customization** → [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md)

---

## Available Agents

All 6 agents work perfectly on Windows:

### 1. **codebase-locator**
Find WHERE code lives (files, functions, patterns)
- Example: "Find all authentication-related files"

### 2. **codebase-analyzer**
Understand HOW code works (detailed analysis)
- Example: "How does the login flow work?"

### 3. **codebase-pattern-finder**
Find similar implementations across the codebase
- Example: "Show me similar API endpoints"

### 4. **thoughts-locator**
Discover relevant documentation (if you add a docs structure)
- Example: "Find docs about authentication"

### 5. **thoughts-analyzer**
Deep dive on documentation
- Example: "Summarize the API design docs"

### 6. **web-search-researcher**
Research external information from the web
- Example: "How does OAuth2 PKCE flow work?"

## Customization

### Modify Command Behavior

Commands are just markdown files! Edit them to customize:

1. Open `.claude/commands/[command-name].md`
2. Edit the instructions
3. Save
4. Command behavior updates immediately

### Add Your Own Commands

1. Create new file: `.claude/commands/my_command.md`
2. Add frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: What this command does
   model: sonnet
   ---

   # Instructions for Claude
   [Your instructions here]
   ```
3. Use it: `/my_command`

### Add Your Own Agents

Same process - create `.claude/agents/my-agent.md` with agent definition.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Don't Appear

**Check:** `.claude/commands/` exists and contains `.md` files
```bash
ls .claude/commands/
```

### Agents Not Working

**Check:** `.claude/agents/` exists and contains `.md` files
```bash
ls .claude/agents/
```

### Linear Commands Fail

**Options:**
1. Set up Linear MCP server and customize IDs
2. Remove Linear integration: `rm .claude/commands/linear.md`

### Git Commands Fail

**Install:** Git for Windows (includes Git Bash)
- Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### GitHub CLI Not Found

**Install:** GitHub CLI
```bash
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

## Best Practices

### Start Simple
1. Use basic commands first (`/research_codebase_nt`, `/commit`)
2. Add Linear integration when needed
3. Customize commands gradually

### Version Control
```bash
git add .claude/
git commit -m "Add Claude Code workflow system"
```

Track your customizations!

### Document Customizations

Create `.claude/README.md` in your project:
```markdown
# Our Claude Code Setup

## Modified Files
- linear.md - Updated with our Linear workspace IDs

## Our Workflow
1. /research_codebase_nt for exploration
2. /create_plan_nt for planning
3. /implement_plan for execution
4. /commit for commits
```

## Support

### Issues with Commands
- Read the command file (they're self-documenting)
- Commands are just markdown with instructions
- See [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) for detailed reference

### Need to Customize?
- See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for creating custom commands and agents
- All commands and agents are fully customizable

### Questions About Original Package
- See: https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer

## Cleanup: What to Delete

You can safely delete the original `claude-workflow-package` folder:
- All Windows-compatible features are in this package
- Original contains macOS-only and HumanLayer-specific files
- See `claude-workflow-windows_archive/` folder for documentation history

The Windows edition includes everything you need: 11 commands, 6 agents, complete documentation, and Linear integration setup. The original package contains macOS-specific session orchestration and HumanLayer CLI dependencies that don't work on Windows.
